# Graph-Project-
This project was done during my third year at Insa Toulouse.
The main purpose of this project was to develop shortest path algorithms(time and distance shortest path).
We implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.
We did some performance tests to proove that the algortihms were well implemented(read performance_test.pdf).
Finally we designed a carpool algorithm thanks to Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm. We worked on the following carpool problem :
there were a pedestrian and a car driver, each one had the same destination but their origin were different, we had to find the best synchronization place to minimize the total carpooling path's cost.
